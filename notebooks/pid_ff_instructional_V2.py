# PID + Feedforward Control Instructional Notebook

## Section 1: Introduction

"""
This notebook is an instructional guide based on real-world experience tuning PID + Feedforward (FF) controllers
for industrial processes. The methodology balances theoretical models with empirical adjustments.
"""

## Section 2: Process Description

# Define key variables
process_description = {
    "controlled_variable": "Temperature (TY201)",
    "manipulated_variable": "Control Valve Opening (VFD206)",
    "disturbance_variable": "Feed flow rate (TY203)",
    "setpoint_variable": "Setpoint from operator interface"
}

# Display process setup
for k, v in process_description.items():
    print(f"{k}: {v}")

## Section 3: Control Strategy Overview

"""
Control Strategy:
- Use PID control to manage the primary loop (TY201).
- Add Feedforward compensation from TY203 to anticipate disturbances.
- Model TY201 response as a function of TY203 using regression or experimental data.
"""

## Section 4: PID Control Logic

from scipy.signal import TransferFunction
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Define a simple second-order process
num = [1]
den = [1, 2, 1]
G = TransferFunction(num, den)

time = np.linspace(0, 20, 500)
t, y = G.step(T=time)

plt.plot(t, y)
plt.title("Step Response of Process")
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Output")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

## Section 5: Feedforward Modeling Placeholder

"""
Placeholder for regression-based or data-derived model of feedforward gain.
Use experimental data to fit TY201 = a*TY203 + b
Then include in control algorithm.
"""

## Section 6: Next Steps

"""
- Add symbolic model using sympy.
- Integrate real data (step test or historical logs).
- Convert control law to PLC-implementable function block.
